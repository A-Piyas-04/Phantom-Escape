I am getting a "Failed to fetch" error in my game project's registering mechanism.  The error likely originates from CRUD functionalities and authentication of profile details.

Context:
The frontend might be usingfetch() to make API requests(not sure)
The backend is in Node.js, and the database is MongoDB.
Authentication may use JWT/session-based authentication(I don't know for sure)
CORS might be a problem since frontend and backend run on different ports.(are they??)

Expected Fix:
Debug the request using the browser console and backend logs.
Check for CORS issues and configure cors properly.
Ensure the correct API endpoint, request method, and headers (Content-Type, authentication tokens).
Confirm that the backend server is running and MongoDB is connected.
Make sure the frontend sends authentication tokens/cookies correctly.
Return meaningful error messages if the issue persists.
